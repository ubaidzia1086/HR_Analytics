**Attrition rate =** (the number of employees who left a company and weren't replaced / the number of employees at the beginning of a specific time period) x 100 

-A high attrition rate can indicate that employees are turning over quickly. A low attrition rate can indicate that people are staying with the company for a longer period of time.
